# AGENTS.md — Mixxx Project Instructions

See [README.md](README.md) for a project overview, and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions, code style,
pre-commit setup, Git workflow, and pull request guidelines.

## AI Agent Policy

> **Important:** This fork of the Mixxx project is aided by the use of AI agents for development, and not all AI-generated code will be disclosed.

## Key Architecture

- **ControlObject/ControlProxy**: `[Group], key_name` inter-component communication.
- **Engine thread**: Real-time audio — no allocations, no locks, may emit Qt signals but cannot receive them.
- **parented_ptr/make_parented**: Qt object-tree ownership. Object must get a parent before `parented_ptr` destructs.
